_project reflections_
the first challenge was figuring out how to use <Link> in react-router and determine when to use either of Link and Route <br>
the second one was the bug I kept getting, "a memory leak because of a react state update happening on an unmounted component which i couldnt figure out. <br>
i also spent a lot of time trying to find ways to use API call results in two differents components by calling it once
i used the lodash library to shuffle the booklist array everytime the user refreshes the page <br>
also had a hard time figuring out how to pass props to the relevant components and even used <Link> for some cases.
